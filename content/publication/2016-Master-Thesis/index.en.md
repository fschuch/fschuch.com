abstract: The studies on transport mechanics and sediment deposition in bed slope channels has rapidly increased over the last decade, this is associated with the fact that they play a fundamental role on the formation of hydrocarbon reservoirs. This work aims to investigate, through direct numerical simulation, the plunge phenomena dynamics when a heavier density fluid, full of particles, flows into a lower density environment. Simulations were carried out with Incompact3d, a code based on a Boussinesq system for incompressible fluids was utilized. The channelâ€™s entrance sediment concentration and flow rate influence on the plunge point and deposition profiles were investigated. Results are compared with theoretical models and physical experiments.
