I have experience in the study of transitional and turbulent flows in natural and industrial environments, also including heat and/or mass transfer, and fluid-structure interaction.
Such works are powered by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools and often supported by High-Performance Computing (HPC).
An advocate of Jupyter Notebook as a tool for production, collaboration, research, and teaching.
Formerly a Postdoctoral researcher at LaSET, the CFD lab at PUCRS.
