- Hi, my name is Felipe;
- I'm glad to be here today **REPRESENTING** our LAB;
- LaSET is the CFD LAB here at PUC rio grande do sul,
- And this is our work: Sandbox flow configuration: A rapid prototyping tool inside XCompact3d

# Motivation

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Starting with the motivation for this work, there are two main points to highlight
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

* How can we speed up our workflow?

  ![alt text](https://mermaid.ink/svg/eyJjb2RlIjoiZmxvd2NoYXJ0IFJMXG4gICAgQShbSHlwb3RoZXNpc10pIC0tPiBTaW11bGF0aW9uc1xuICAgIHN1YmdyYXBoIFNpbXVsYXRpb25zXG4gICAgICAgIENvZGUgLS0-IENvbXBpbGUgLS0-IERlYnVnIC0tPiBSdW4gLS0-IENvZGVcbiAgICBlbmRcbiAgICBTaW11bGF0aW9ucyAtLT4gQyhbUmVzdWx0c10pXG4gICAgQyAtLT4gRChbQ29uY2x1c2lvbnNdKVxuICAgIEQgLS0-IEFcbiIsIm1lcm1haWQiOnsidGhlbWUiOiJiYXNlIiwidGhlbWVWYXJpYWJsZXMiOnsiZm9udEZhbWlseSI6ImFyaWFsIiwiZm9udFNpemUiOiIyMHB4In19LCJ1cGRhdGVFZGl0b3IiOmZhbHNlfQ)

* Can we improve the learning curve for beginners in our code?

{{< speaker_note >}}
- The first is:
  - How can we speed up our workflow?
  - I mean, the iterations here the scientific PROCESS;
  - But more specifically, How can we speed up the iterations here in the simulation cycle.

- and the second point:
  - Can we improve the learning curve for beginners in our code?
  - And especially, how to help them to **code new** flow configurations, going beyond the benchmark cases.
{{< /speaker_note >}}

### Identifying the main challenges

- Using parallel computation in a distributed-memory system and Message Passing Interface;

<img alt="" height="85%" width=auto src="2d_decomp.png">

<small> _Illustration of the 2D domain decomposition from [2DECOMP&FFT](http://www.2decomp.org/decomp.html)._ </small>

- Coding, compiling, testing, debugging and handling I/O in Fortran.

{{< speaker_note >}}
- This leads us to identify the main challenges in our workflow, if we want to make it easier for beginners and faster for developers;
- I would say, the PARALLEL DECOMPOSITION **IS GREAT** for performance and scalability, but it takes a while to master allocation, transpositions and all the MPI calls;
- Besides that, coding, compiling, testing, debugging and handling I/O in Fortran is not so easy, it is another point that we would like to improve.

# Methodology

{{< speaker_note >}}
- The PROBLEMS WERE identified, now, lets see how to solve them!
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

Sandbox Flow Configuration ([BC-Sandbox.f90](https://github.com/fschuch/Xcompact3d/blob/master/src/BC-Sandbox.f90))

<!-- ![alt text](mermaid-diagram-20210310173223.svg) -->
![alt text](mermaid-diagram-20210310111106.svg)

- The initial set-up is imported from external files;
- The choice of the external tool is up to the user:
  - Fortran, Matlab, Octave;
  - Python with just [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) or more specific tools ([Py4Incompact3D](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Py4Incompact3D) or [Xcompact3d-toolbox](https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox));
- It adds no extra dependency to the workflow.

{{< speaker_note >}}
- This is the Sandbox Flow configuration.
- Of course, xcompact3d already reads the PARAMETERS FILE at initialization, but with the new `MODULE SANDBOX`, the entire initial set-up can be imported from the disk;
- Using it, we can customize any new flow configuration with no need to RECOMPILe the code every time.
- The initial set-up includes case specific definitions, like: Initial condition; Boundary conditions; Geometry; Others.
- It can be provided EXTERNALLY.
- We wanted to keep it simple, so, the choice of what to use is **totally** up to the user:
  - It can be Fortran, Matlab, Python, and many others, as long as you can write binary arrays in the same fashion that xcompact3d would do.
- And here we have a good point: This framework can speed up our workflow, and at the same time, there is no extra **DEPENDENCIES** to install.
{{< /speaker_note >}}

### Variables handled by `Sandbox`

- Initial condition for velocity and scalar field(s);
- Inflow profiles for velocity and scalar field(s) (if `nclx1=nclxS1=2`);
- Top and bottom boundary values for scalar field(s) (if `nclyS1=2` or `nclySn=2`);
- Customized operator for the imposition of constant flow rate (if `nclx1=nclxn=0`);
- $\epsilon$ array, describing the solid geometry for IBM (if `iibm $\ne$ 0`).

<small>See [README](https://github.com/fschuch/Xcompact3d/blob/master/examples/Sandbox/README.md) for more details.</small>

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Here we see what we can do with sandbox:
  - We should always specify the initial condition for velocity and the scalar fields;
But the other arrays are just demanded in specific situations:
  - Like, we can specify inflow profiles for velocity and scalar if we use Dirichlet boundary condition where x is equals to 0;
  - We can also set scalar values at the bottom and top boundaries if we use Dirichlet;
  - We can specify a customized operator if we want to impose a constant flow rate in a periodic flow;
  - And we set a `epsilon` array if using Immersed Boundary Method.

{{< /speaker_note >}}

### An example using Python and Numpy

```python
import numpy as np

ux = np.zeros(shape=(nx, ny, nz), dtype=np.float64)
uy = np.zeros_like(ux)
uz = np.zeros_like(ux)
phi = np.zeros(shape=(nx, ny, nz, numscalar), dtype=np.float64)

# Sequence of operations to set the initial condition

ux.T.tofile('./data/ux.bin')
uy.T.tofile('./data/uy.bin')
uz.T.tofile('./data/uz.bin')
for n in range(numscalar):
    phi[:,:,:,n].T.tofile('./data/phi{}.bin'.format(n+1))
```

<small>**Note**: The initial set-up can be provided from any other language, as long as the files are written as raw binaries (compatible with [2DECOMP&FFT](http://www.2decomp.org/)) and the filenames are correct.</small>

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Here is an example of how to set the initial condition in Python with Numpy;
- We initialize the arrays with the right shape and data type;
- Then, we take advantage of Python's flexibility and readability to set the values for our flow configuration; Besides, we can combine with other tools to plot, compute and test our set-up.
- And finally, we write them to the disk, so they will be available for the `module sandbox`.

### Cases Covered by `Sandbox`

| Case | IC | BC | FRC | IBM | LMN |
| ---- |:--:|:--:|:---:|:----|:---:|
| Channel-Flow | :heavy_check_mark: | | :heavy_check_mark: | | |
| Cylinder | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark: | |  :heavy_check_mark: | |
| Lock-exchange | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | | | :warning: |
| Periodic Hill | :heavy_check_mark: | | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | |
| Taylorâ€“Green vortex | :heavy_check_mark: | | | | |
| TBL | :heavy_check_mark: | :warning: | :warning: | | |

<small>**Note**: Initial Condition (**IC**); Boundary Conditions (**BC**); Flow rate Control (**FRC**); Immersed Boundary Method (**IBM**); Low Mach Number (**LMN**).</small>

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Here we see an estimation of the cases covered by sandbox at this moment;
- We can simulate Channel-flow, flow around a cylinder, Periodic Hill and TGV;
- Density current in the lock-exchange will work too, as long as we are not using the low mach number approach, it was not implemented in the module yet;
- And the turbulent boundary layer demands more specific definitions of boundary conditions and flow rate control, so it is also not supported.
- But, like I told you, it is just an estimation, because now we can play around and modify any of these cases.

# Case Study

{{< speaker_note >}}
- For example, we are going to **merge** the periodic channel and the flow around a cylinder...
{{< /speaker_note >}}

### Periodic Heat Exchanger

<img alt="Flow Visualization with Passive Scalar Field" width="35%" height=auto src="Heat-exchanger.jpg">

- Periodic boundary conditions in x and z;
- A cylinder at the center with low temperature;
- No-slip conditions for velocity at top and bottom, besides, high temperature at the walls.

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Besides combining it with HEAT TRANSFER, in what I called, **The Period Heat Exchanger**.
- We have periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise and spanwise directions;
- A cylinder at the center of the domain with its dimensionless temperature fixed at zero;
- And no-slip BC at the bottom and top walls, and their temperature fixed in one.
- Lets see how to code it!
{{< /speaker_note >}}

### Initialization

```python
>>> import xcompact3d_toolbox as x3d
>>> import xcompact3d_toolbox.sandbox
>>> prm = x3d.Parameters(loadfile='input.i3d')
>>> dataset = x3d.sandbox.init_dataset(prm)
>>> dataset
```
```text

```

{{< speaker_note >}}
- I'm using xcompact3d-toolbox just because I'm more familiar with it;
- We start here importing the Package;
- Lets say that we already had set all the correct parameters at the input file, so now we load it;
- And we start the dataset. It is returned to us with the proper dimensions, coordinates and the SEVEN data variables that we are going to work with now
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

### Boundary Conditions

High temperature at the bottom and top walls:

$$
\Theta(x,y=0,z,t) = 1
$$

$$
\Theta(x,y=L_y,z,t) = 1
$$

```python
>>> dataset["byphi1"] += 1.0
>>> dataset["byphin"] += 1.0
```
{{< speaker_note >}}
- We start setting the temperature as one at the bottom and top walls, like specified for our new flow configuration;
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

### Initial Condition

<img alt="" width="40%" height=auto src="vertical_vel_prot.svg">

```python
>>> dataset["ux"] += velocity_profile + random_noise
>>> dataset["uy"] += random_noise
>>> dataset["uz"] += random_noise
>>> dataset["phi"] += 1.0
```

<small>**Note:** Part of the code was not presented, for simplicity.</small>

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Now, lets set the initial condition for the streamwise velocity as this vertical profile in addition to some random noise, and just random noise for uy and uz;
- And the initial temperature will be one everywhere.
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

### Geometry

```python
>>> epsi = x3d.sandbox.init_epsi(prm)
>>> for array in epsi.values():
...     array = array.geo.cylinder(x=prm.xlx / 2.0, y=prm.yly / 2.0)
...
>>> epsi["epsi"].isel(z=0).plot()
```

<img alt="" width="40%" height=auto src="epsi.jpg">

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Now it is time to set the geometry, a cylinder in the center of the domain.
- Notice that xcompact3d-toolbox includes methods to draw many standards geometries.
- Here we are using the cylinder, we just have to specify its center and we are good to go.
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

### Flow rate Control

```python
>>> dataset["vol_frc"] += prm.dy / prm.yly / prm.nx / prm.nz
>>> dataset["vol_frc"][dict(y=0)] *= 0.5
>>> dataset["vol_frc"][dict(y=-1)] *= 0.5
>>> dataset["vol_frc"] = dataset.vol_frc.where(epsi == False, 0.0)
>>> dataset.vol_frc.isel(z=0).plot()
```

<img alt="" width="40%" height=auto src="frc.jpg">

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Since the domain is periodic in x, we need to specify a forcing term to maintain a constant flow rate,
and actually, we can specify a customized operator for the volumetric integration.
- This one will give us a unitary value per **HEIGHT** unit, and will include an average in x and z.
- We multiply both top and bottom plane by half because of the composed trapezoidal rule for integration;
- And of course, we can disconsider the cylinder when integrating.
{{< /speaker_note >}}

---

- Now we save the arrays to the disk:
  ```python
  >>> dataset.x3d.write(prm)
  >>> x3d.gene_epsi_3D(epsi, prm)
  ```
- And run the simulation:
  ```bash
  mpirun -n [number of cores] ./xcompact3d |tee log.out
  ```
- There is no need to recompile the code every time;
- We can code, test, plot and debug the initial set-up interactively in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (or any other computational tool).

{{< speaker_note >}}
- Now it is time to write all the variables to the disk and run the simulation;
- Notice that there is no need to recompile the code every time;
- And we can code, test, plot and debug the initial set-up using any computational tool, like a Jupyter Notebook, and make it very interactive;

- Here we see an animation of the case that we just coded, the periodic heat exchanger;
- I have a few more examples to show to you

{{< speaker_note >}}
- We are looking in a top view, that is presenting the depth-averaged concentration of the turbidity current in asymmetric configuration.
- This one is just like Ricardo explained to us earlier in HIS talk,
- but this time the denser fluid starts here at the bottom left corner and can spread in more directions.
- We can se the lobes-and-clefts near the front, how some rings are formed in the body and them they break down, and many other nice features.

{{< speaker_note >}}
- End the last example is the flow around a square with passive scalar as a visualization tool.
- Here at the inlet we have this smooth step function for the passive scalar, as a result, we can see this nice pattern downstream due to the turbulence;
- As always, everything is very CUSTOMIZABLE. We could change the position of the square, we could include more squares; change the number os steeps here at the inlet;
- You can see the complete code here in this link, and you can access the slides using the QR code at the end of this talk.
